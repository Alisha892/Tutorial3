          Every digital devices generates the elctromagnetic radiations and electromagnetic fields. Smartwatches and fitness trackers work with WLAN and bluetooth raidiation. If the body is permanently exposed to this radiation it can have detrimental effect on our health over time.More than thousand scientific studies have confirmed it.
        </p>
        <li style="color: white; font-size: larger;">Shorter Battery Life</li>
